About the Mod

Soul Storage allows a player to save levels of exprince with in a coin.

How it works

Once the coin is crafted the user holds it in there hand and right clicks. His current levels are than stored in the coin while removing any expreince left in the players XP bar as the price of storing the levels. 

If the user wants to retive the levels from the coin all that has to be done is a seconed right click and  all of the exprince with in the coin is returned to the user.

Futher Expansion

Soul Bench – Allows a player to transfer and enchanmet from one item to another using a custome work bench. The bench will use player experince as a cost.
Boat and Minecart Enchantments – Adds new enchantmets for both boats and minecarts.

FAQ

Why Coins

One of my goals is to have players use exprince for battering. Coins just made since.

You know Mojang will be adding XP Books

...yep, still going to add the coins. If every modder stop doing somthing becouse the orignal game auther might add somthing simular to the game than half the mods out there would not exist.
